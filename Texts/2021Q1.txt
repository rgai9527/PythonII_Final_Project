Quarterly markets review - Q1 2021
US equities gained in Q1, despite starting uncertainly. Unusual, highly targeted trading activity saw markets rattled in January, before recovering as optimism over significant government stimulus took root.

President Biden first confirmed a fiscal stimulus package of $1.9 trillion, which was followed up with an additional promise of $2 trillion in infrastructure spending. Energy, financials and industrials made strong gains. Technology and consumer staples lagged.
