Quarterly markets review - Q4 2019
US equities made robust gains in Q4 as trade uncertainty faded with the US and China’s phase one trade deal announcement, while economic data remained stable. The trade deal, which is due to be signed in mid-January, means the planned new tariffs will not be imposed, while US tariffs imposed in September on $120 billion Chinese goods will be reduced by half. The US’ 25% tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods will remain. China has also agreed to increase purchases of US goods, with agricultural produce highlighted.

The Federal Reserve cut interest rates once in the quarter before indicating that "the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate". The US economy expanded by 2.1% (annualised) in Q3; this was better than expected and stronger than in Q2. While we await the Q4 growth data, the unemployment release in early December showed that joblessness declined to 3.5% - its lowest point since 1969 - with better-than-expected wage inflation. Forward-looking data such as the purchasing managers’ indices, which survey the manufacturing and services sectors, continues to indicate modest expansion.

The tech sector was among the principal beneficiaries of the easing trade tensions. Energy stocks, which had lagged the broader S&P 500 index materially in 2019, rallied as the oil price rose on lower-than-expected supply. Real estate – which is typically less exposed to economic growth – lagged, although industrials were also flatter over the month.
