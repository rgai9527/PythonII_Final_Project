Quarterly markets review - Q4 2020
US equities gained over the quarter, with November especially strong due to the vaccine news. The developments eclipsed Joe Bidenâ€™s win in the US presidential election, as well as a $900 billion stimulus package announced in late December. The Federal Reserve nonetheless reinforced its supportive message, stating it will continue with current levels of quantitative easing. Economically sensitive sectors made the strongest gains, with more defensive sectors making more modest progress.
