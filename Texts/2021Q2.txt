Quarterly markets review - Q2 2021
The second quarter was strong for US equities, and indeed the S&P 500 reached a new all-time high in late June. Almost all sectors made gains over the quarter.

The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) rate-setting meeting brought no change to policy but its projections indicated that interest rate rises could come in 2023. This seemed to wrong-foot some market participants, though subsequent comments by Fed officials sought to allay any worries over tightening monetary policy too quickly.

Overall, the economic picture remained rosy. Q1 GDP grew at 6.4% (quarter-on-quarter, annualised), which was modestly lower than the consensus of 6.7%. Growth in consumption was especially strong. Industrial activity as measured by US composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI) moved from 59.7 in March, to a (flash) composite reading of 63.9 in June. The PMI indices, produced by IHS Markit, are based on survey data from companies in the manufacturing and services sectors. A reading above 50 signals expansion.

Inflation data, unsurprisingly, received a lot of attention. In May, core consumer price index (CPI) inflation rose from 3% to 3.8% year-on-year - the largest increase since June 1992, with the “reopening theme” a big driver.

In late June President Joe Biden also secured a deal on an infrastructure package worth about $1 trillion to upgrade roads, bridges and broadband networks over the next eight years. The agreement fell short of the $2.3 trillion infrastructure spending plan announced in March, and did not address the social safety-net spending proposed in April.

Tech giants like Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft made strong gains over the quarter. By sector, energy, IT, communication services and real estate were amongst the strongest areas of the market. Utilities and consumer staples lagged.
