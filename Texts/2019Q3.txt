Quarterly markets review - Q3 2019
US equities made modest gains in Q3, despite ongoing growth concerns and uncertainty surrounding US-China trade. The growth concerns were most pronounced in August, when the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) conservative messaging around its policy response underwhelmed investors. The Fed acted as expected by cutting rates by 25 basis points both in July and in September, but has not committed verbally to a more extended easing cycle. The US yield curve inverted in the month, a phenomenon which often precedes recession. Despite the ebb and flow of optimism over a trade war resolution, any concrete plans to remedy the ongoing US-China dispute remain elusive. Increasing speculation over possible impeachment proceedings for President Trump further added to uncertainty.

US economic data was largely stable, albeit it continued to moderate. Unemployment remains at 3.7% and wage growth in August was stronger (month-on-month) than anticipated. However, new non-farm job additions were lower than expected in August, at 130,000 versus predictions of 158,000. Consumer confidence also weakened; the August Conference Board consumer confidence index fell to 125.1 from 134.2 (the index reflects prevailing business conditions and likely developments for the months ahead, detailing consumer attitudes and buying intentions).

Less economically sensitive areas of the market generally performed more strongly. Utilities, real estate and consumer staples were amongst the quarter’s better performers. Energy and materials were weaker areas of the market, given expectations of a more challenging demand environment. Healthcare remains a matter of heated debate in the run-up to the 2020 US presidential election, and the political sensitivity caused the sector to lag the market.
